# 🎤 Lyrics Generator 🎶

This project is a **Lyrics Generator** built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of song lyrics and is capable of generating new, stylistically similar lyrics word-by-word or line-by-line.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- NLP (Tokenization, Text Preprocessing)
- LSTM / GRU / GPT architecture
- Streamlit (for Web App UI)
- Jupyter Notebook (for training and experimentation)

## 🚀 Features

- Trains on your own lyrics dataset
- Generates lyrics line-by-line
- Customizable temperature to control randomness
- Web app UI for interactive generation

pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare dataset

Place your .txt file with song lyrics in the data/ folder.

Make sure the lyrics are line-separated.

Train the model

Use notebooks/model_training.ipynb to train your model.

Alternatively, load the pretrained model if provided.

Run the web app

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py

📊 Model Training
The model uses a recurrent neural network (LSTM/GRU) to learn sequence prediction.

Text is tokenized using a word-level tokenizer.

Loss function: Categorical Crossentropy

Optimizer: Adam

📌 TODO
 Add GPT-based version

 Add genre/style selector

 Add fine-tuning on user-uploaded lyrics
